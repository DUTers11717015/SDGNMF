# Sparse dual graph-regularized NMF for image co-clustering

  This repo implements the iterative updating process of the proposed clustering algorithm for "Sparse dual graph-regularized NMF for image co-clustering" by Jing Sun et al.. The code implements the clustering experiments on the face (ORL-32 and PIE-pose27) and object (COIL20) datasets to obtain AC and NMI, and then verifies the clustering effectiveness of SDGNMF. Besides, the code can also show the sparseness study and run time of ours to compare with other NMF-based clustering methods.

## This paper implements the iterative updating process of the proposed clustering algorithm.
